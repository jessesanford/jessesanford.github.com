I am in the process of setting up a new machine so I figured it would be a great time to compile a list of the software I have come to rely upon in my day to day life. I would try to keep it as cross platform as possible but fortunately/unfortunately I have been a mac head for a few years now and although I am most comfortable in front of a command line I have to use a gui from time to time.

Let's start with the root of it all: Zsh
Oh-My-Zsh: <a href="https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh" title="oh-my-zsh at github">https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh</a>

Also I am really liking this guy's dotfiles:
<a href="https://github.com/jelera/dotfiles" title="Jelera's dotfiles at github">https://github.com/jelera/dotfiles</a>

Next a good terminal
Iterm2: <a href="http://www.iterm2.com/#/section/home" title="Iterm 2 site">http://www.iterm2.com/#/section/home</a>

Now a good editor 
VIM/Macvim: <a href="http://code.google.com/p/macvim/" title="MacVim site">http://code.google.com/p/macvim/</a>

<a href="http://www.jessesanford.com/2011/09/07/vim-plugins-i-am-using/" title="Jesse Sanford's minimal list of vim plugins">Checkout my MINIMAL list of VIM plugins and vimrc.</a> (NERDTree, Colors etc.)

Ruby/Rack
<ol>
Just started using Pow 0-config stack: <a href="http://pow.cx/" title="0 config ruby and rack stack for mac">http://pow.cx/</a>
It comes with RVM so it really can't hurt that much.</ol>
Turns out that pow starts a node server and reset's the mac firewall to point ALL http traffic at it. This will cause you MANY "WTF"s as you try to find out why you can't run apps in any other http application stack. Sorry pow you are out. Standar RVM install and then macruby or your favorite ruby blend on top.


PHP/Mysql
Why not use MAMP and save yourself some time: <a href="http://www.mamp.info" title="Mamp site">http://www.mamp.info</a>

Package Management
I was an avid macports user for a long time but now I am strictly Homebrew: <a href="http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/" title="Homebrew site">http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/</a>

Now install your favorite git/svn/hg/postgres/mongodb/python/perl versions!

Don't forget wget/curl/tmux/screen

A way to browse
Chrome: <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome" title="chrome site">http://www.google.com/chrome</a>

A way to browse with only the keyboard
Vimium: <a href="http://vimium.github.com/" title="vimium site">http://vimium.github.com/</a>

A way to communicate:
Adium: <a href="http://adium.im/" title="adium site">http://adium.im/</a>

The new iChat in lion is pretty nice too!

Arrange windows intelligently:
Optimal Layout: <a href="http://most-advantageous.com/optimal-layout/" title="optimal layout site">http://most-advantageous.com/optimal-layout/</a>

Share files
DropBox: <a href="http://www.dropbox.com" title="dropbox site">http://www.dropbox.com</a>

Backup files:
Jungle Disk: <a href="http://www.jungledisk.com" title="jungle disk site">http://www.jungledisk.com</a>
Also looking forward to the new iCloud.

Keep Notes
<a href="http://www.evernote.com" title="evernote site">http://www.evernote.com</a>

Mail/Calendar/Documents
GOOGLE! I know it's crazy to trust them with everything but it's so friggin easy! I download and backup all of my content regularly on s3 and locally.

App Launcher
For the most part I use spotlight but I have been using 
Alfred: <a href="http://www.alfredapp.com" title="alfred site">http://www.alfredapp.com</a> lately as well.

Virtualization
I have tried other hypervisors but keep coming back to VMware fusion: <a href="http://www.vmware.com/mac" title="vmware site">http://www.vmware.com/mac</a>

IDE
I am trying not to use these big heavy guys these days but if I need to step through a debugger I have to admit it's much more fun to use a gui than it is to use the cli of (insert first character of language here)db.

One Eclipse for javascript/node.js: Latest with v8 debugger: <a href="https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Using-Eclipse-as-Node-Applications-Debugger" title="eclipse v8 debugger tutorial at joyent github">https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Using-Eclipse-as-Node-Applications-Debugger</a>

Another Eclipse for Android/java: Latest with the android sdk: <a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/eclipse-adt.html" title="google android sdk eclipse install">http://developer.android.com/sdk/eclipse-adt.html</a>

Netbeans 6.9.x with the Ruby/Rails support is nice: <a href="http://netbeans.org/features/ruby/index.html" title="Netbeans 6.9 ruby rails support">http://netbeans.org/features/ruby/index.html</a>

Netbeans 7.x with the PHP/Symfony support is also nice:
<a href="http://netbeans.org/features/php/" title="Netbeans 7.x php support">http://netbeans.org/features/php/</a>

Of course. Textmate. But I have to say this software is getting more and more outdated. Can I just re-iterate for the millionth time Where the hell is textmate 2?
<a href="http://macromates.com/" title="textmate site">http://macromates.com/</a>

There will certainly be more to come. This is just what I could think of in an afternoon.
