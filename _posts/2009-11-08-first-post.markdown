After nearly a decade of the "cobler's children have no shoes" I have decided to pick this blog back up again and write about my experiences as a software architect. I am planning a few articles on my work specializing in highly durable, highly available, horizontally scalable open source architectures pertaining not only to the web but to any massively concurrent application. Any questions, comments or topic suggestions are gladly accepted.
